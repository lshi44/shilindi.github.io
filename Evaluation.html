        <h2> Takumi's father:  </h2>
        <p>I have been trying for all these years to guild him to do something right, but it seems that my son never follow. I am not going to visit his place! I have seen him sending me photos. There is no way to step in. For so many time I want to have another son to success my job. I am not wealthy, but at least I have no trouble support my family. Takumi still askes me to pay for his rent these years. Such a shame! </p>

        <h2>The grocery store manager:</h2>
        <p>Takumi is so lazy that he usually come to his shift two hours later. You asking me why I keep him for so many years? It is unusual to find anyone like him who is so easy to be satisfied. Other people might ask for higher wages or health insurance, but this guy has no idea what to look for. By the way I don't need to worry about anything if he is taking the late night shift. Lazy as he is, still an honest man. Totally trustable.  </p>

        <h2>A co-worker:</h2>
        <p>I can't believe that anyone would stay on the position like this for decades. Takumi-san is a man like this. If I were him, I might be moving to somewhere else. No body likes to stick to one place, I mean. expect for him. Speaking about this person, en, I don't like to chat with him for Takumi-san always thing himself so charming and popular, which is not true in fact. But I like to work with him. Takumi-san helped me for many times in this jib and covered my shift some time. By the way, his mangas are so bad. Please tell him nobody want to read thing likt that anymore. </p>

        <h2>Takumi's dogs:</h2>
        <p>We love our masters!	We like to take walk with him every morning and night. Woof! Woof! Woof!</p>
